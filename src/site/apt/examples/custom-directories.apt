Specifying custom source directories

    As mentioned on the basic {{{usage.html}usage}} page, the plugin expects
    a certain source directory layout by default.  Users can configure the plugin
    to expect a different layout instead.  Consider the following layout:

+----+
src/main/resources/
    css/
    images/
+----+

    We can tell the <jDocBook Style Plugin> to use these directories by
    specifying so in the configuration:

+----+
<project>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jboss.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-jdocbook-style-plugin</artifactId>
                <extensions>true</extensions>
                <configuration>
                    <cssSourceDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/css</cssSourceDirectory>
                    <imagesSourceDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/images</imagesSourceDirectory>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
