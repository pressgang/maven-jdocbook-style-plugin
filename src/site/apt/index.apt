jDocBook Style Plugin

    The <jDocBook Style Plugin> defines a dedicate packaging
    ("jdocbook-style") for projects defining shared DocBook "style bundles".
    These style bundles are considered to be comprised of (1) custom XSLT,
    (2) custom images, (3) custom css, and (4) custom fonts.  Having a dedicated
    packaging for these support resources is useful in two ways:

    [[1]] It allows enforcing a consistent structure or layout inside the
        packaged archive.

    [[2]] It allows users of the package to assume a consistent layout within
        the packaged archive.

    []

* Goals Overview

    As already mentioned, the plugin defines a custom packaging.  As part of
    that, it defines a custom set of lifecycle phase bindings.  Below are the
    phases the plugin defines and the goals bound to each lifecycle phase:

    [process-resources] binds the {{{resources-mojo.html}jdocbook-style:resources}}
        goal which "stages" the resources need for the XSLT transformations into the
        output directory.

    [package] binds the standard jar:jar goal.

    [install] binds the standard install goal.

    [deploy] binds the standard deploy goal.

    []
