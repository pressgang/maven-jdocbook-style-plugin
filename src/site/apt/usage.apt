Basic Usage

    The <jDocBook Style Plugin> defines a custom packaging.  Thus, the most
    basic usage of the plugin is to utilize the defined packaging as the project
    type.

* Minimal configuration

    The minimal configuration for the plugin is:

+----+
<project>
    <groupId>com.mygroup</groupId>
    <artifact>myproject</artifactId>
    <type>jdocbook-style</type>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jboss.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-jdocbook-style-plugin</artifactId>
                <extensions>true</extensions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
+----+

    Which assumes the default source layout:

+----+
src/main/
    css/
    fonts/
    images/
    xslt/
+----+
